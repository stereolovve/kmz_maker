# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an empty project directory named "lista_obras" (Portuguese for "list of works"). The repository currently contains only configuration files:

- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Claude Code permissions configuration
- `.vscode/settings.json` - VS Code workspace customization with green theme colors

## Architecture

The project structure is minimal and appears to be in initial setup phase. No source code, build configuration, or documentation files are present yet.

## Development Commands

No build, test, or lint commands are currently configured. This will need to be set up once the project technology stack is determined.

## Notes

- The directory name suggests this may be a Portuguese project related to managing or listing works/projects
- VS Code is configured with a green color theme
- Claude Code has basic file system permissions configured
- The project is not yet initialized as a git repository
